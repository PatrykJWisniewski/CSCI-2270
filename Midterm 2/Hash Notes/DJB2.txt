The DJB2 Algorithm

The pseudocode and explanation:


int hash(string word){
  int hash = 5381;
  for each character c in word:
    hash = hash*33 + c;
  hash = hash % hashTableSize;
  if(hash < 0) hash+=hashTableSize;
  return hash;
}



A simple sum of ASCII values would result in a
collision between all words made up of the same characters (cat and act, for
example). The DJB2 hash avoids this by applying the multiplication step as it
iterates through the characters in the string. However, due to repeated
multiplication, it is possible that the hash value will undergo integer overflow.
That is the reason for the check to see if the hash value is less than 0.
